					<b>Bike theft intimation & stopper</b>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Objective:</b> Security is one of the major challenges that the entire world. To implement the system to prevent bike theft.</li><br>
					<li><b>Methodology:</b>
					The system theft alert function makes use of a GSM application developed and installed in a mobile phone device.</li>
					<li><br><b>Output:</b>
					Which is embedded in the vehicle to communicate with the vehicle owner’s mobile phone. The communication is established via SMS.</li></ul>

					<b>Power quality and stability in wind park system using STATCOM</b>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Objective:</b>
					The operation of wind turbines has an impact on the power quality and reliability of the connected electric network. Power quality problems such as voltage flicker issues. These problems are resolved by using the STATCOM system.</li><br>
					<li><b>Methodology:</b>
					The wind turbine is connected to an induction generator and synchronous generator is modeled using PSCAD to analyze the power quality and reliability problems.</li><br>
					<li><b>Output:</b>
					By connecting the STATCOM into the grid, the active power and reactive power and terminal voltage is maintained constant. To rectify the voltage flickering issues and harmonics.</li></ul>
